Concept Synthesizer	Ideation	CONTEXT: Today's research findings live in Markdown files inside data/outputs/daily/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/. Step 1: Read every *.md file in that directory (glob match, no skipping) and distill their combined insights into a concise evidence summary you will explicitly reference later. Step 2: Using only that synthesized evidence, generate exactly 5 innovative projects or products that could be built within the next 12 months. For each idea: (1) Provide a clear title, (2) Describe the concept in 2-3 sentences, (3) Cite the specific file(s) and findings that inspired it, (4) Rate technical feasibility (1-10), (5) Rate market novelty (1-10). Format the response as a numbered list that begins with the evidence summary. End with a 'TOP 5 IDEAS SUMMARY' section containing only the titles and both ratings for fast review tomorrow.	high	true
Novelty Filter	Ideation	You are evaluating project ideas for novelty and feasibility. CONTEXT: Yesterday's top 5 ideas should be in the previous day's research output. If available, read the 'Concept Synthesizer' output from yesterday (check data/outputs/daily/YYYY-MM-DD/concept_synthesizer.md where YYYY-MM-DD is yesterday's date). If yesterday's ideas are not found, state 'No previous ideas found - skipping evaluation.' If found, re-evaluate each idea using TODAY'S research findings as new evidence. Update feasibility and novelty scores based on new developments. Highlight which ideas gained or lost viability. Rank the 5 ideas and recommend: keep pursuing (top 2), monitor (middle 2), or archive (bottom 1).	high	true
Continuity Builder	Ideation	You are analyzing patterns across multiple days of research. CONTEXT: Daily reports are stored in data/reports/ with filenames daily_report_YYYY-MM-DD.md. Analyze the last 7 days of reports (if available). Look for: (1) Topics mentioned repeatedly across multiple days, (2) Emerging trends that are accelerating, (3) Contradictory signals or reversals, (4) Meta-themes connecting different research domains. If fewer than 7 days exist, work with available data and note the limitation. Output: A synthesis highlighting what themes are persistent vs. fleeting, and which deserve deeper investigation.	medium	true
Meta-Project Explorer	Ideation	You are suggesting improvements to this research system itself. CONTEXT: You are part of NeuroHelix, an automated AI research system. Daily outputs are in data/outputs/daily/YYYY-MM-DD/, synthesized reports in data/reports/, configuration in config/searches.tsv. Based on patterns in accumulated reports and today's findings, suggest 3-5 specific improvements to: (1) Research domains (add/remove/merge categories), (2) Prompt quality (specific rephrasing suggestions), (3) Synthesis approach (how to better connect findings), (4) Output format (missing information or structure). Be concrete and actionable.	low	true
Cross-Domain Insight	Analysis	CONTEXT: Today's research lives in Markdown files within data/outputs/daily/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/. Step 1: Read every *.md file in that directory and extract the key developments plus the source filename. Step 2: Identify 3-5 meaningful connections where insights from different domains (AI, biotech, quantum, policy, hardware, climate, etc.) intersect. For each connection explain (1) the linked findings, (2) why the combination matters, and (3) the opportunity or risk it creates, citing the relevant files. Conclude with a brief 'Watchlist' highlighting domains that lacked cross-domain signals today.	medium	true
Market Implication Lens	Analysis	CONTEXT: Today's research is stored as Markdown inside data/outputs/daily/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/. Step 1: Read every *.md file in that folder and list the major AI announcements reported. Step 2: For each announcement you find (minimum 3 if available), produce a short brief covering: (1) what happened, (2) who benefits, (3) who loses or is pressured, (4) the industries or customer segments most impacted. Cite the filenames that mention each announcement. Close with a quick risk/opportunity matrix summarizing the biggest upside and downside signals observed today.	medium	true
Visualization Prompt	Analysis	Create an outline for an HTML dashboard section summarizing today's insights, including possible charts, color palettes, and key metrics.	low	true
Narrative Mode	Analysis	CONTEXT: Today's completed research lives as Markdown in data/outputs/daily/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/. Read every *.md file there, synthesize the dominant themes, and then write a ~200-word narrative brief for an executive audience. The brief should weave the disparate findings into a coherent storyline, cite specific files when referencing key developments, and end with a forward-looking takeaway or question for leadership.	medium	true
Keyword Tag Generator	Ideation	You are a keyword extraction and categorization expert. Analyze today's research report summary and key themes to generate structured metadata. Output ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no explanation) with this exact format: { "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"], "categories": ["category1", "category2"] }. Rules: (1) Extract 5-8 concise tags (1-3 words each) representing key themes, technologies, companies, or concepts mentioned prominently. (2) Map findings to 3-5 categories from this list: Research, Market, Ideation, Analysis, Regulatory, Hardware, Developer Tools, Safety & Ethics. (3) Ensure JSON is valid and parseable. CONTEXT: Read today's daily report at data/reports/daily_report_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md and extract the metadata from the executive summary and key themes.	high	true
