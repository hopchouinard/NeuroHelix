Concept Synthesizer	Ideation	Analyze today's research findings and generate exactly 5 innovative project or product ideas that could be built within the next 12 months. For each idea: (1) Provide a clear title, (2) Describe the concept in 2-3 sentences, (3) Identify which research findings inspired it, (4) Rate technical feasibility (1-10), (5) Rate market novelty (1-10). Format your response as a numbered list with clear sections. At the end, create a 'TOP 5 IDEAS SUMMARY' section with just the titles and ratings for easy reference tomorrow.	high	true
Novelty Filter	Ideation	You are evaluating project ideas for novelty and feasibility. CONTEXT: Yesterday's top 5 ideas should be in the previous day's research output. If available, read the 'Concept Synthesizer' output from yesterday (check data/outputs/daily/YYYY-MM-DD/concept_synthesizer.md where YYYY-MM-DD is yesterday's date). If yesterday's ideas are not found, state 'No previous ideas found - skipping evaluation.' If found, re-evaluate each idea using TODAY'S research findings as new evidence. Update feasibility and novelty scores based on new developments. Highlight which ideas gained or lost viability. Rank the 5 ideas and recommend: keep pursuing (top 2), monitor (middle 2), or archive (bottom 1).	high	true
Continuity Builder	Ideation	You are analyzing patterns across multiple days of research. CONTEXT: Daily reports are stored in data/reports/ with filenames daily_report_YYYY-MM-DD.md. Analyze the last 7 days of reports (if available). Look for: (1) Topics mentioned repeatedly across multiple days, (2) Emerging trends that are accelerating, (3) Contradictory signals or reversals, (4) Meta-themes connecting different research domains. If fewer than 7 days exist, work with available data and note the limitation. Output: A synthesis highlighting what themes are persistent vs. fleeting, and which deserve deeper investigation.	medium	true
Meta-Project Explorer	Ideation	You are suggesting improvements to this research system itself. CONTEXT: You are part of NeuroHelix, an automated AI research system. Daily outputs are in data/outputs/daily/YYYY-MM-DD/, synthesized reports in data/reports/, configuration in config/searches.tsv. Based on patterns in accumulated reports and today's findings, suggest 3-5 specific improvements to: (1) Research domains (add/remove/merge categories), (2) Prompt quality (specific rephrasing suggestions), (3) Synthesis approach (how to better connect findings), (4) Output format (missing information or structure). Be concrete and actionable.	low	true

Keyword Tag Generator	Ideation	You are a keyword extraction and categorization expert. Analyze today's research report summary and key themes to generate structured metadata. Output ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no explanation) with this exact format: { "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"], "categories": ["category1", "category2"] }. Rules: (1) Extract 5-8 concise tags (1-3 words each) representing key themes, technologies, companies, or concepts mentioned prominently. (2) Map findings to 3-5 categories from this list: Research, Market, Ideation, Analysis, Regulatory, Hardware, Developer Tools, Safety & Ethics. (3) Ensure JSON is valid and parseable. CONTEXT: Read today's daily report at data/reports/daily_report_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md and extract the metadata from the executive summary and key themes.	high	false
