concept_synthesizer	Concept Synthesizer	search	Ideation	gemini-2.5-flash		0.8	64000	180	3	sequential	concept_synthesizer.md	CONTEXT: Today's research findings live in Markdown files inside data/outputs/daily/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/. Step 1: Read every *.md file in that directory (glob match, no skipping) and distill their combined insights into a concise evidence summary you will explicitly reference later. Step 2: Using only that synthesized evidence, generate exactly 5 innovative projects or products that could be built within the next 12 months. For each idea: (1) Provide a clear title, (2) Describe the concept in 2-3 sentences, (3) Cite the specific file(s) and findings that inspired it, (4) Rate technical feasibility (1-10), (5) Rate market novelty (1-10). Format the response as a numbered list that begins with the evidence summary. End with a 'TOP 5 IDEAS SUMMARY' section containing only the titles and both ratings for fast review tomorrow.

CONTEXT: Yesterday's top 5 ideas should be in the previous day's research output. If available, read the 'Concept Synthesizer' output from yesterday (check data/outputs/daily/YYYY-MM-DD/concept_synthesizer.md where YYYY-MM-DD is yesterday's date). If yesterday's ideas are not found, state 'No previous ideas found - skipping evaluation.' If found, re-evaluate each idea using TODAY'S research findings as new evidence. Update feasibility and novelty scores based on new developments. Highlight which ideas gained or lost viability. Rank the 5 ideas and recommend: keep pursuing (top 2), monitor (middle 2), or archive (bottom 1).	Evaluate yesterday's ideas with new evidence

CONTEXT: Daily reports are stored in data/reports/ with filenames daily_report_YYYY-MM-DD.md. Analyze the last 7 days of reports (if available). Look for: (1) Topics mentioned repeatedly across multiple days, (2) Emerging trends that are accelerating, (3) Contradictory signals or reversals, (4) Meta-themes connecting different research domains. If fewer than 7 days exist, work with available data and note the limitation. Output: A synthesis highlighting what themes are persistent vs. fleeting, and which deserve deeper investigation.
